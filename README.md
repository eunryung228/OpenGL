# OpenGL

this is the game term-project which is made by OpenGL(C++).<br>
I just studied OpenGL SO basically, so the code is not perfect.<br>
Maybe there are some bugs in this game. :);


## Main Story

Main character's name is 'Lee Saza', looks like a lion.(saza means lion in Korean)<br>
He is the sophomore of the computer engineering.<br>
He is in danger of being expelled from university.<br>
So he has to get good grade in ANYWAY.



## Rules

There are good items to LeeSaza.<br>
They help player to play the game long.<br>

And there are bad items to LeeSaza, too.<br>
They disturb player to play the game.<br>
If you get some bad items, you will face the game over scene.
